I am a third year MPhil/PhD student @ UoWarwick Maths and Stats Centres of Doctoral Training (CDT). My work is mainly focused on the problems of optimal stopping and reinforcement learning with an unknown gain function.
In my 1st year project I explored how Reservoir Computing (a state-space systems which can be thought of as a type of Recurrent Neural Networks) can be applied to Reinforcement Learning. The project was supervised by Dr Lyudmila GrigoryevaLink opens in a new window and Dr Nick TawnLink opens in a new window.

Reasearch Interests
======
My main area of research interests is concerned with multivariate statistics, particularly networks analysis, networks clustering, and graph neural networks:
* Optimal stopping and optimal control
* (Inverse) reinforcement learning
* Deep learning
* Statistical machine learning
* Multivariate statistics, dynamic networks analysis and networks clustering

I am also broadly interested in different areas of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data processing and analysis. As a part of my research I'm working on developing Python applications and pipelines which can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/annakuchko) profile.
