I am a first year MPhil/PhD student @ UoWarwick Maths and Stats Centres of Doctoral Training (CDT)
I have 2+ years of working experience in consulting, IT and banking where I learned by doing how to efficiently utilise Python, R and Big Data processing tools for data analysis. In the meantime I completed my undergraduate degree at the Samara State University of Economics majoring in Business analytics and Statistics.

Reasearch Interests
======
My main area of research interests is concerned with multivariate statistics, particularly networks analysis, networks clustering, and graph neural networks:
* Time-series analysis (high-frequency modelling, clustering)
* Financial networks clustering for portfolio optimisation
* Clustering algorithms for improved predictions
* Neural networks applications
* Trees-based machine learning algorithms
* Anomalies detection 

I am also broadly interested in different areas of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data processing and analysis. As a part of my research I'm working on developing Python applications and pipelines which can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/annakuchko) profile.
