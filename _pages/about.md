Hi! My name is Anna and I am and aspiring ML/AI researcher and the final year MPhil/PhD student @ UoWarwick Maths and Stats Centres of Doctoral Training (CDT). My work is mainly focused on the problems of solving inverse optimal stopping problems (think of teaching self-driving cars to react and stop in hazadous situations).

Reasearch Interests
======
I am highly interested in solving control problems with Machine Leanring and AI tools. My academic and professional interests include (but are not limited to):

* (Inverse) reinforcement learning
* Vision Language Models and Vision Language Action Models
* Deep learning
* Optimal stopping and optimal control
* Statistical machine learning
* Multivariate statistics, dynamic networks analysis and networks clustering

 As a part of my research I'm working on developing Python applications and pipelines which can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/annakuchko) profile.
