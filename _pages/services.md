Are you looking for a data scientist, machine learning specialist, or AI engineer to help turn your ideas into working solutions? I bring a research-backed perspective from my MPhil/PhD work in statistics and machine learning together with hands-on industry experience to deliver high-impact projects. From exploratory analysis through deployment, I partner closely with teams to make sure insights are explainable, robust, and ready for real-world use.

## How I can help

- **End-to-end ML projects:** Scoping, experimentation, model development, and evaluation for classification, forecasting, recommendation, or vision-language tasks.
- **AI product prototyping:** Rapidly iterating on proofs of concept, integrating foundation models, and validating feasibility before full-scale investment.
- **MLOps and automation:** Designing reproducible workflows, data pipelines, and deployment strategies so models stay reliable in production.
- **Decision intelligence:** Translating complex analytics into clear narratives, dashboards, and decision support tools for stakeholders.

## What it's like to work together

1. **Discovery.** We define the business problem, success criteria, and data realities to ensure the work is aligned with your goals.
2. **Design & build.** I develop transparent models and pipelines, sharing progress through regular check-ins and collaborative reviews.
3. **Deliver & support.** You receive actionable insights, well-documented code, and guidance on next steps or ongoing maintenance.

Whether you need a short-term expert to accelerate a sprint or a longer-term collaborator, I'm happy to tailor an engagement that fits your team.
