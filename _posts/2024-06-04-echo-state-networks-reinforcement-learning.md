## Why Echo State Networks for Policy Learning?

My [ESN-for-RL](https://github.com/annakuchko/ESN-for-RL) project explores how **Echo State Networks (ESNs)** can serve as expressive memory modules for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. RL policies often struggle with partial observability and non-stationary signals. ESNs, with their large fixed recurrent reservoirs and trainable linear readouts, offer a lightweight way to inject temporal context without expensive backpropagation through time.

I set up a research notebook to answer a simple question: *Can we plug an ESN reservoir into the observation pipeline of an RL agent and get more stable learning curves?*

## Project Structure and Tooling

The repository combines scientific Python tooling:

- **PyTorch** for differentiable components and policy optimization.
- **NumPy** and **SciPy** utilities to generate random reservoirs and spectral radius normalization.
- **Gymnasium** environments for standardized continuous-control tasks.
- Lightweight visualization helpers (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`) to chart reward trajectories and reservoir activations.

This mix lets me iterate quickly on ideas like reservoir size sweeps, sparsity patterns, and teacher forcing schedules.

## Experiment Highlights

1. **Reservoir Warm-Up** – Before handing over control to the RL agent, I feed the ESN a short sequence of environment observations so that hidden states settle into a rich attractor.
2. **Feature Augmentation** – The ESN readout produces a compact state embedding that augments raw observations, allowing policy networks to condition on a richer temporal context.
3. **Adaptive Sparsity** – I experimented with different sparsity levels in the reservoir weight matrix and found that moderate sparsity (~10%) keeps the reservoir expressive while controlling computational cost.

Across classic control benchmarks (CartPole, Acrobot, and MountainCar), the ESN-enhanced agent converged faster than a baseline MLP policy in most runs. The biggest gains appeared when rewards were sparse or highly delayed.

## Key Takeaways

- Reservoir computing still has room in modern RL—especially when data efficiency matters.
- ESNs can be treated as plug-and-play feature generators, enabling compatibility with a wide range of policy optimization algorithms (PPO, DQN, SAC).
- Future work includes adapting the reservoir online and exploring meta-learning strategies to reuse reservoirs across tasks.
